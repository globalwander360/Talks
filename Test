JIRA Title

Increase Unit Test Code Coverage for dpw-docstore Service

Description

The dpw-docstore service currently has low unit test coverage, which increases the chance of regressions and makes future changes harder to validate confidently.
This task focuses on improving unit test coverage by adding missing test cases for major business flows, including both positive and negative scenarios.

The expected code coverage after completion should be around 70%.

Acceptance Criteria

Missing unit test cases are added for uncovered modules

Critical business logic is covered with success and failure scenarios

All tests pass successfully in local and CI pipeline

No functional changes are introduced as part of testing updates
