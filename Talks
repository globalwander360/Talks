Hi Everyone,

The changes mentioned in IGS-4739 have been implemented.
In IGS-4024, a new button has been added and user access has been provided.
In IGS-4023, the document handling for XML generation has been managed on the backend.

The requirements for these JIRAs have already been implemented.

Thanks.
