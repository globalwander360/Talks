It looks like you’re sharing a code snippet for an Angular form with a custom multi-select component, and then you’ve listed some CXT Product Codes. Based on this context, I assume you want help integrating or displaying these product codes in the form — maybe in a similar multi-select or dropdown fashion.

If You Want to Add CXT Prod Code as Another Select Field

Here’s how you can structure the code to include a similar dropdown for CXT Prod Code:

<div class="input-row">
  <p>CXT Prod Code</p>

  <ng-dpw-multi-select
    [options]="cxtProdCodeOptions"
    [resetFilterOnHide]="true"
    [style]="{ width: '100%' }"
    formControlName="cxtProdCode"
    (change)="onChange($event.value, 'cxtProdCode')"
  ></ng-dpw-multi-select>
</div>

In Your Component (.ts) File

Define the options like this:

cxtProdCodeOptions = [
  { label: 'EC (Export Collection)', value: 'EC' },
  { label: 'IC (Import Collection)', value: 'IC' },
  { label: 'EL (Export LC)', value: 'EL' },
  { label: 'LC (Import LC)', value: 'LC' }
];

Additional Tips

If sectorOptions is coming from an async pipe (observable), you can also make cxtProdCodeOptions observable if needed.

Adjust the formControlName and event logic depending on your form group setup.

Ensure you have a corresponding form control initialized in your FormGroup.


Let me know if you want a dropdown instead of a multi-select or need it conditionally based on selected sector.
